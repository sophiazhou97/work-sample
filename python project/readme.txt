Bioinformatics genome project

This project aims to find the donor genome by aligning the reads from the donor genome to the reference genome.

basic_hasher.py: 
Align all the reads to the most likely positions in the reference genome. It takes in a reference genome, a set of reads and an output file and outputs the reads aligned to the reference genome into the output file.

complex_pileup.py: 
Takes in aligned reads and an output file and outputs the SNPs and indels called based on the aligned reads. It uses an edit distance approach to call variants. â€¨
You can test the code by 
python3 basic_hasher.py -g practice_E_1/ref_practice_E_1_chr_1.txt  -r practice_E_1/reads_practice_E_1_chr_1.txt -o test_hasher.txt
python3 complex_pileup.py -a test_hasher.txt -o test_pileup.txt -t practice_E_1_chr_1
